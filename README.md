## Problem Definition
The main of our project is to develop a predictive model to assess the likelihood of loan default, aiding lending institutions in mitigating financial risk and making informed decisions. By accurately predicting whether a borrower will pay off their loan, we aim to provide lenders with a valuable tool for assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants and reducing potential losses due to defaults.

## Models Used

1. Decision Tree Classifier 
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest Classifier

## Conclusion

- Popularity and budget have low linear correlation value with ratings (watch out for bandwagons ðŸ¤£)
- Popularity of the casts and crews have higher linear correlation value with ratings
- Resampling imbalanced data improved model performance especially on the minority class
- Logistic Regression did not perform well with non-linearly correlated variables
- Neural Networks along with SMOTEENN resampling method consistently did well in predicting good movies after 100 training attempts (around 72% accuracy, 70% recall)
- Yes, it is possible to predict if a movie is good with acceptable amount of accuracy and recall

## What did we learn from this project?

- Handling imbalanced datasets using resampling methods and imblearn package
- Neural Networks, Keras and Tensorflow
- Logistic Regression from sklearn
- API Usage
- Other packages such as tqdm, json, requests
- Collaborating using GitHub
- Concepts about Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
