## Problem Definition
The main of our project is to develop a predictive model to assess the likelihood of loan default, aiding lending institutions in mitigating financial risk and making informed decisions. By accurately predicting whether a borrower will pay off their loan, we aim to provide lenders with a valuable tool for assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants and reducing potential losses due to defaults.

## Models Used

1. Decision Tree Classifier 
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest Classifier

## Conclusion

- 

## What did we learn from this project?

- Handling imbalanced datasets using resampling methods
- Chi Square Statistic, Cramers V 
- Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier from sklearn
- Collaborating using GitHub
- Concepts about Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
